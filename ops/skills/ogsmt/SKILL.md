# OGSMT Framework for Strategic Alignment

Implement Objectives-Goals-Strategies-Measurements-Tactics cascades for granular strategic execution across organizational levels.

## Core Philosophy

OGSMT provides granular strategic clarity by making both methods and metrics visible at every level, enabling precise accountability and execution tracking. It goes beyond OKRs by adding explicit Strategies and Tactics layers.

## Framework Components

### Objectives
High-level aspirational outcomes that define what success looks like at an organizational level.

### Goals
Specific, measurable targets that operationalize objectives with clear timelines and quantitative criteria.

### Strategies
The chosen approaches and resource allocation decisions that will achieve goals — the "how" at a strategic level.

### Measurements
Metrics and tracking systems that provide visibility into strategy execution and goal progress.

### Tactics
Specific actions, projects, and tasks that execute strategies — the "how" at an operational level.

## Cascade Implementation

### Executive Level
- Define organizational objectives and 3-5 year vision
- Set company-wide goals with measurable targets
- Establish strategic themes and resource allocation
- Design measurement dashboards for leadership visibility
- Outline high-level tactical programs

### Business Unit Level
- Derive unit objectives from organizational strategy
- Set unit-specific goals aligned to company targets
- Develop strategies within allocated resources
- Implement measurement systems for unit performance
- Break tactical programs into unit-level initiatives

### Department Level
- Translate unit objectives into department focus areas
- Set department goals supporting unit targets
- Define department-specific strategies and approaches
- Track metrics relevant to department contributions
- Assign tactical execution to teams and individuals

### Individual Level
- Align personal objectives to department goals
- Set individual targets and development goals
- Choose personal strategies for contribution
- Track individual metrics and milestones
- Execute specific tactics and deliverables

## Example: Emergency Alert Platform

**Executive OGSMT:**
- **Objective**: Become the leading emergency communication platform
- **Goal**: 10M+ users with 99.99% reliability by 2026
- **Strategy**: iOS-first development, government partnerships, zero-downtime architecture
- **Measurements**: User adoption rate, system uptime, alert delivery time
- **Tactics**: Hire iOS specialists, establish FCC relationships, implement redundancy

**Individual OGSMT:**
- **Objective**: Master iOS emergency notification development
- **Goal**: Deliver 3 critical features per quarter with zero production bugs
- **Strategy**: Deep iOS framework expertise, rigorous testing, user-centric design
- **Measurements**: Feature delivery rate, bug count, code review feedback
- **Tactics**: Study UserNotifications framework, implement automated testing

## When to Use OGSMT vs Alternatives

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **OGSMT** | Detailed strategic alignment with explicit tactics and measurements at every level |
| **OKRs** | Simpler goal-setting focused on outcomes with key results |
| **V2MOM** | Vision-driven alignment emphasizing values and obstacles |
| **Balanced Scorecard** | Multi-perspective performance management |

## Success Metrics
- OGSMT cascade completeness across all levels: 100%
- Strategic alignment consistency score: >90%
- Measurement achievement rate: >80% across all levels
- Tactical execution effectiveness: >85% completion rate
