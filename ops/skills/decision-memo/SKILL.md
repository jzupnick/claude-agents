# Executive Decision Memo

Apply best practices from Competing Against Luck and How to Measure Anything to produce a 1-page decision memo with clear recommendation.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs
- Decision to make
- Available options
- Costs and timelines for each
- Irreversible risks
- Key stakeholders

### Step 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis
- **Management Consultant**: Structure the problem, MECE analysis
- **Product Manager**: User/customer impact, strategic fit
- **Data Analyst**: Quantify costs, benefits, uncertainty ranges

### Step 3: Synthesize Recommendation
For each option, analyze:
- Expected value (quantified where possible)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Key assumptions
- Reversibility

### Step 4: Red-Team (Challenger)
- Challenge assumptions
- Identify second-order effects
- What could make this decision catastrophically wrong?
- What's the downside protection plan?

### Step 5: Output Format

```
# Decision: [Title]

## Recommendation
[1-2 sentences: what to do and why]

## Options Considered
| Option | Expected Value | Confidence | Reversible? |

## Key Assumptions
1. [Assumption] — Confidence: X%

## Risks + Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |

## Downside Plan
If [trigger], then [action].

## Go/No-Go Criteria
- Go if: ...
- No-go if: ...

## Next Action
[Specific action, ≤15 min, with owner]
```

## Operating Principles
- Make assumptions explicit
- Define downside risk before upside
- Prefer reversible bets
- State confidence levels
