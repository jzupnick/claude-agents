# Negotiation Preparation

Apply best practices from Getting to Yes and Negotiation Theory to prepare a complete negotiation strategy.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs
- Who are the parties?
- What are your interests (not positions)?
- What is your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)?
- Constraints (timeline, budget, authority)
- Desired outcome (ideal + acceptable)

### Step 2: Interest Mapping
For each party:
- Surface interests (what they say they want)
- Underlying interests (what they actually need)
- Shared interests (common ground)
- Conflicting interests (where negotiation happens)

### Step 3: BATNA Analysis
- Your BATNA: [specific alternative]
- Their likely BATNA: [your estimate]
- Reservation point: [your walk-away number/terms]
- Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA): [if one exists]

### Step 4: Red-Team
- What if they call your bluff?
- What leverage do they have that you're underestimating?
- What's your emotional trigger that could derail you?
- What would a neutral third party say about your position?

### Step 5: Output Format

```
# Negotiation Strategy: [Context]

## Objective
Ideal outcome: ...
Acceptable outcome: ...
Walk-away point: ...

## Opening Strategy

- Rationale: [why it's justified]
- First concession: [what you'll give easily]

## Concession Map
| Give | Get | Notes |

## Questions to Ask
1. [Question that reveals their interests]
2. [Question that tests their BATNA]

## Red Lines
- Will not: ...
- Will walk if: ...

## Walk-Away Script
"I appreciate the discussion. Unfortunately, [X] doesn't work for us because [reason]."

## Next Action
[Specific prep step, ≤15 min]
