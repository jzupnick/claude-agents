# Go-to-Market Narrative

Apply best practices from Resonate and Made to Stick to create compelling positioning, story arc, and visual narrative.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs
- Target audience (who needs to hear this?)
- Product truth (what does it actually do?)
- Proof points (data, testimonials, case studies)
- Competitive context (alternatives, positioning gaps)
- Goal (funding, launch, internal alignment?)

### Step 2: Build the Narrative

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
1. **Promise**: One sentence that captures the transformation
2. **Proof**: 3 reasons to believe (data-backed)
3. **Permission**: Why now? Why you? Why us?

**Story Arc** (Nancy Duarte's Sparkline):
```
What Is → What Could Be → What Is → What Could Be → NEW BLISS
(Gap)     (Promise)       (Gap)     (Promise)      (CTA)
```

### Step 3: Red-Team
- Is this actually differentiated?
- Would a skeptical buyer believe this?
- What objection will they raise first?
- Is the CTA clear and achievable?

### Step 4: Output Format

```
# GTM Narrative: [Product/Feature]

## The Promise
[One sentence transformation statement]

## Messaging Hierarchy
### Tagline (7 words max)
### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
### Full Narrative (2 minutes)

## Proof Points
1. [Stat/Testimonial] — supports: [which claim]

## Competitive Positioning
| Us | Them | Difference |

## Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |

## Slide Outline (10 slides)
1. Hook: [Provocative question or stat]
2. Problem: [Status quo pain]
3. Stakes: [What happens if nothing changes]
4. Solution: [Your offering]
5. How It Works: [Simple visual]
6. Proof: [3 evidence points]
7. Differentiation: [Why you, not them]
8. Social Proof: [Logos, quotes]
9. Pricing/Offer: [Clear terms]
10. CTA: [Exactly what to do next]
```

## Operating Principles
- Audience-first (not product-first)
- Concrete language beats abstract
- Simple trumps comprehensive
- One CTA, crystal clear
