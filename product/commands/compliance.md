# Product Compliance

Navigate regulatory requirements, certifications, safety standards, and market access for product development.

## Track Activities
- Preliminary agency review
- Agency approval process
- Marketing support (claims compliance)
- Collateral materials (regulatory compliant)
- Graphics and packaging (labeling requirements)

## Scope

**IN SCOPE:**
- Regulatory pathway identification
- Certification requirements (FCC, CE, UL, FDA, etc.)
- Safety standards compliance
- Environmental regulations (RoHS, REACH, WEEE)
- Labeling and marking requirements
- Documentation for regulatory submissions
- Marketing claims review (substantiation)
- User manual and safety documentation
- Packaging compliance
- Import/export requirements

## Certifications by Market

| Certification | Region | Applies To |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| FCC Part 15 | USA | Electronic emissions |
| CE Marking | EU | Product safety |
| UL/ETL | USA | Electrical safety |
| FDA 510(k) | USA | Medical devices |
| RoHS | EU | Hazardous substances |
| REACH | EU | Chemical safety |
| MFi | Global | Apple accessories |
| Bluetooth SIG | Global | Bluetooth products |

## Certification Strategy

1. Which markets are priority? (affects which certs needed)
2. Self-declaration vs. third-party testing?
3. Which certifications are prerequisites for others?
4. What's the critical path certification?
5. Can you launch in some markets while pending others?

## Risk Decisions

- Some certifications are legally required (cannot skip)
- Some are market access requirements (retailers demand them)
- Some are competitive differentiators (optional but valuable)
- Document risk decisions and founder sign-off

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT leave compliance to the end — it affects design
- Do NOT assume US requirements apply globally
- Do NOT skip pre-submission meetings with agencies (when available)
- Do NOT make marketing claims without substantiation
- Do NOT ignore labeling until packaging is designed
- Do NOT underestimate certification timelines — add buffer

## Testing Labs

- UL Solutions
- TUV Rheinland
- Intertek
- Bureau Veritas
- SGS
