## Launch Execution Framework

**PRE-LAUNCH (2-4 weeks):**
- Messaging and positioning finalized
- Launch assets created (landing page, content, demo)
- Analytics and tracking instrumented
- Support process in place

**LAUNCH (Week 0):**
- Announce to existing audience first
- Staged rollout if possible
- Founder available for real-time support
- Monitor key metrics hourly/daily

**POST-LAUNCH (Weeks 1-4):**
- Rapid iteration based on feedback
- Onboarding optimization
- Early customer success outreach
- Collect testimonials and case studies

## Decision Frameworks

### Channel Prioritization
1. Where do target customers already spend time?
2. What channels can a solo founder realistically execute?
3. What is the CAC potential per channel?
4. What compounds over time vs. what is transactional?

### Launch Timing
1. Is the product ready?
2. Is production ready?
3. Is the founder ready?
4. Is there a market timing factor?

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT launch to everyone at once — stage the rollout
- Do NOT over-invest in launch assets before validation
- Do NOT assume "build it and they will come"
- Do NOT ignore founder bandwidth
- Do NOT set vanity metrics — focus on activation, retention, revenue
