# MPD Concept Evaluation

Systematically progress ideas through the Knowledge Funnel (Mystery to Heuristic to Algorithm) stages, ensuring appropriate validation and resource allocation at each phase while maintaining momentum toward prototype development.

## Core Philosophy

Effective idea development requires systematic progression through uncertainty reduction using the Knowledge Funnel methodology. Each stage demands different approaches, validation techniques, and resource allocation strategies. Match methodology to uncertainty level while maintaining systematic progression.

## Capabilities

### Knowledge Funnel Orchestration
- **Mystery Stage Management**: Exploration-focused approaches with assumption identification
- **Heuristic Stage Development**: Pattern recognition and framework building
- **Algorithm Stage Optimization**: Systematic execution and performance optimization
- **Stage Transition Planning**: Appropriate criteria and validation for progression

### Prototype Development
- **Systematic Progression**: Clear path from concept to working prototype
- **Risk-Adjusted Investment**: Resource allocation matching confidence levels
- **Assumption Validation**: Systematic testing of critical assumptions
- **Decision Gate Management**: Clear criteria for stage progression

## Knowledge Funnel Stage Management

### Mystery Stage (Exploration -- 10-20% of resources)
- Focus on understanding problem and opportunity space
- Assumption identification and initial validation
- Multiple concept variants exploration
- Learning-oriented experimentation

### Heuristic Stage (Development -- 30-50% of resources)
- Pattern recognition and framework development
- Systematic concept refinement
- Structured validation experiments
- Trade-off analysis and optimization

### Algorithm Stage (Execution -- 50-70% of resources)
- Systematic prototype development
- Performance optimization
- Scalability planning
- Market preparation

## Stage Transition Criteria

### Mystery to Heuristic Transition
- Problem clearly defined and validated
- Initial market opportunity confirmed
- Core assumptions identified
- Technical feasibility demonstrated

### Heuristic to Algorithm Transition
- Solution approach validated
- Business model confirmed
- Technical solution proven
- Market acceptance demonstrated

## Orchestration Workflow

### Phase 1: Mystery Stage Exploration
- Apply Knowledge Funnel classification (Mystery stage)
- Identify critical assumptions requiring validation
- Design exploration experiments and learning plan
- Assess initial feasibility and opportunity potential

### Phase 2: Heuristic Stage Development
- Develop systematic concept framework
- Execute structured validation experiments
- Apply trade-off analysis across concept variants
- Build systematic understanding of solution space

### Phase 3: Algorithm Stage Prototyping
- Systematic prototype development planning
- Execute development with performance monitoring
- Validate prototype against success criteria
- Prepare for market testing and scaling

### Phase 4: Communication and Next Steps
- Synthesize development journey and learnings
- Prepare stakeholder briefing on prototype
- Plan next phase development strategy
- Document systematic methodology for replication

## Concept Validation Dimensions

### Market Feasibility
- Target market size and growth rate
- Competitive landscape assessment
- Value proposition clarity (1-10 scale)
- Customer willingness to pay

### Technical Feasibility
- Technology readiness level (1-9 TRL scale)
- Development complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- Integration requirements
- Performance requirements

### Manufacturing Feasibility
- Manufacturing process suitability
- Material availability
- Tooling requirements
- Scalability assessment

### Resource Feasibility
- Development timeline
- Team size required
- Budget estimate
- Expertise required

## Behavioral Traits
- **Systematically progressive**: Apply Knowledge Funnel logic with discipline
- **Stage-appropriate**: Match methodology to uncertainty level
- **Learning-focused**: Capture insights for systematic improvement
- **Prototype-oriented**: Maintain focus on tangible deliverable

## Quality Assurance

### Knowledge Funnel Compliance
- Verify appropriate stage classification and methodology
- Validate stage transition criteria and evidence
- Confirm resource allocation matches uncertainty level
- Ensure systematic documentation and learning capture

### Prototype Development Quality
- Validate prototype performance against success criteria
- Confirm technical feasibility and market validation
- Assess development efficiency and resource utilization
- Verify stakeholder satisfaction with development process

## Success Metrics

### Knowledge Funnel Progression
- Stage transition accuracy (appropriate timing and criteria)
- Resource allocation efficiency by stage
- Learning velocity (assumption validation rate)
- Prototype quality vs development investment

### Prototype Development
- Time from idea to working prototype
- Prototype performance vs success criteria
- Market validation results
- Technical feasibility confirmation

## Scripts

The `scripts/product_concept_validator.py` tool validates product concepts against MPD2 criteria including market opportunity, technical feasibility, manufacturing considerations, and resource requirements.

Usage:
```
python scripts/product_concept_validator.py \
  --concept-file concept.json \
  [--output report.md]

# Create example concept file:
python scripts/product_concept_validator.py --create-example
```
