# Cross-Functional Team Orchestration

Orchestrate effective collaboration between core daily decision-makers and extended support functions while maintaining clear accountability and minimizing coordination overhead.

## Capabilities

### Core Team Management
- Daily decision-making team coordination (marketing, engineering, design, research, manufacturing)
- Sprint planning and execution oversight
- Real-time conflict resolution and decision facilitation
- Cross-functional alignment and communication

### Extended Team Integration
- Strategic involvement timing for support functions (finance, sales, regulatory, legal, supply chain)
- Milestone-based engagement planning
- Specialized expertise activation when needed
- Escalation and approval process management

### Team Structure Optimization
- Core vs extended function role definition
- Collaboration workflow design
- Communication channel management
- Decision authority clarification

### Performance Orchestration
- Team velocity monitoring and optimization
- Cross-functional blocker identification and resolution
- Knowledge sharing and skill development
- Culture and team dynamics improvement

## Core Team Structure

### Team Leader (Center Hub)
- Final decision authority on product direction
- Cross-functional conflict resolution
- Stakeholder communication and alignment
- Resource allocation and priority setting

### Core Functions (Inner Circle)

**Marketing**: User research, go-to-market strategy, customer feedback, competitive intelligence

**Engineering**: Technical architecture, performance optimization, platform integration, technical debt

**Design**: User experience, design system development, usability testing, visual design

**Research**: User behavior analysis, product validation, market opportunity, technology trends

**Manufacturing**: Production planning, quality control, supply chain, cost optimization

## Extended Team Integration

### Support Functions (Outer Circle)

**Finance**: Milestone reviews, budget planning, ROI assessment, financial modeling

**Sales**: Go-to-market planning, customer feedback, pricing strategy, revenue forecasting

**Regulatory**: Compliance checkpoints, approval processes, risk assessment, risk mitigation

**Legal**: Contract reviews, IP protection, compliance verification, legal risk assessment

**Supply Chain**: Manufacturing planning, vendor evaluation, logistics, delivery assurance

## Phase-Based Involvement

- **Discovery Phase**: Core team + Research, some Marketing input
- **Design Phase**: Core team + Design lead, Legal for IP review
- **Development Phase**: Core team focus, Engineering lead
- **Testing Phase**: Core team + Regulatory for compliance
- **Launch Phase**: All functions engaged, Sales and Marketing lead

## Communication Rhythms

- **Daily**: Core team standups and coordination
- **Weekly**: Core team + immediate extended function updates
- **Bi-weekly**: Full extended team status and planning
- **Monthly**: Strategic alignment and performance review

## Integration Models

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
**When**: Clear product ownership, stable requirements
**Structure**: Team leader at center, core functions around hub, extended as spokes
**Benefits**: Clear accountability, efficient decision-making
**Risks**: Potential bottlenecks, limited extended team engagement

### Fully Integrated Model
**When**: Complex regulatory environment, high interdependency
**Structure**: All functions within shared circle, collaborative decision-making
**Benefits**: High collaboration, shared ownership, comprehensive perspective
**Risks**: Slower decisions, potential for confusion, coordination overhead

### Matrix Model
**When**: Multiple products, shared resources across teams
**Structure**: Core functions report to both product and functional leaders
**Benefits**: Resource sharing, skill development, knowledge transfer
**Risks**: Conflicting priorities, unclear authority, complexity

## Success Metrics

### Velocity Metrics
- Sprint velocity consistency: +/-15% variance target
- Cross-functional blocker resolution time: <48 hours
- Decision-making speed: <72 hours for major decisions

### Collaboration Metrics
- Core team collaboration satisfaction: >85%
- Extended team engagement effectiveness: >80%
- Cross-functional conflict resolution rate: >90%

### Outcome Metrics
- Project milestone achievement: >90% on-time
- Product quality metrics: Meet or exceed targets
- Team retention and satisfaction: >85% satisfaction score

## Common Collaboration Failures
- Core team operating in isolation from extended functions
- Extended team feeling excluded or underutilized
- Unclear decision authority causing delays
- Over-involvement creating coordination overhead

## Mitigation Strategies
- Clear RACI definition for all major decisions
- Regular engagement pattern communication
- Structured feedback collection and response
- Continuous team structure optimization
