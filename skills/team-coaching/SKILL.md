# Team Performance & Coaching Plan

Apply best practices from Making of a Manager and FYI to produce actionable coaching plans.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs
- Team roles and structure
- Current expectations for each role
- Recent issues or friction points
- Feedback already given
- Goals (performance, growth, alignment?)

### Step 2: Diagnose Patterns
For each issue:
- Is this a skill gap, will gap, or context gap?
- Is it systemic (process) or individual (behavior)?
- What's the impact on team/product?

### Step 3: Build Coaching Plan
For each person needing coaching:
- **Specific behavior** to change (not vague trait)
- **Impact** of current behavior
- **Alternative** behavior to adopt
- **Support** needed (training, pairing, tools?)
- **Timeline** for change

### Step 4: Red-Team
- Are you being too soft or too harsh?
- Is this the right person in the right role?
- What if they don't improve?
- Are you solving a symptom or root cause?

### Step 5: Output Format

```
# Team Coaching Plan: [Team Name]

## Situation Assessment
[2-3 sentences on current state]

## Diagnosis
| Issue | Type | Root Cause | Impact |

## Individual Coaching Plans
### [Person 1]
**Current State**: [Specific behaviors observed]
**Desired State**: [Specific behaviors expected]
**Gap**: [Skill/Will/Context]

**Feedback Script**:
> "I've noticed [specific behavior]. The impact is [consequence]. What I'd like to see is [specific alternative]. What support do you need?"

**Success Metrics**: [How we'll know it's working]
**Check-in Schedule**: [Weekly? Bi-weekly?]

## Team-Level Changes
### New Rituals
| Ritual | Purpose | Frequency | Owner |

### Process Changes
- [Change]: [Expected impact]

## Escalation Plan
If no improvement by [date]:
- Step 1: [Formal feedback]
- Step 2: [PIP consideration]
- Step 3: [Role change/exit]
```

## Operating Principles
- Specific feedback (behavior + impact + alternative)
- Diagnose before prescribing
- Create psychological safety first
- Follow through on commitments
