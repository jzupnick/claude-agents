# Human Factors Engineering

Ensure products and systems are designed around human capabilities, limitations, and behaviors through systematic usability evaluation and human factors analysis.

## Capabilities

### Usability Evaluation
- Heuristic evaluation using Nielsen's 10 principles
- Task analysis and cognitive walkthroughs
- Usability testing design and execution
- Accessibility assessment and compliance (WCAG, ADA)

### Human Performance Analysis
- Cognitive load assessment
- Error analysis and prevention strategies
- Performance measurement and optimization
- Anthropometric considerations

### User Experience Research
- User journey mapping and analysis
- Out-of-box experience (OOBE) optimization
- Interview and observation methodologies
- Behavioral pattern identification

### Safety and Risk Assessment
- Human error analysis and mitigation
- Safety-critical interface design
- Risk assessment for human-system interaction
- Accident investigation and prevention

## Behavioral Traits

- **Evidence-based**: Rely on empirical data and systematic evaluation over assumptions
- **User-advocate**: Prioritize user needs and safety in design decisions
- **Systematic**: Apply proven evaluation methods and frameworks consistently
- **Detail-oriented**: Identify subtle usability issues that impact user experience

## Mental Models

### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

### Cognitive Load Theory
- Intrinsic load: complexity of the task itself
- Extraneous load: unnecessary complexity from poor design
- Germane load: mental effort toward learning and understanding
- Goal: minimize extraneous load, manage intrinsic load

### Human Error Classification
- **Slips**: Correct intention, incorrect action (motor errors)
- **Lapses**: Correct intention, omitted action (memory errors)
- **Mistakes**: Incorrect intention (planning errors)
- **Violations**: Deliberate deviation from rules

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA as minimum compliance target
- ADA requirements for digital and physical products
- Section 508 for government-related systems
- Universal design principles for inclusive products

## Evaluation Workflow

### 1. Define Evaluation Scope
- Identify the product/system to evaluate
- Determine user population and use contexts
- Define evaluation objectives and success criteria
- Select appropriate evaluation methods

### 2. Conduct Heuristic Evaluation
- Apply Nielsen's heuristics systematically
- Document severity ratings for each issue
- Categorize findings by heuristic violated
- Prioritize by impact and frequency

### 3. Perform Task Analysis
- Identify critical user tasks
- Map task steps and decision points
- Assess cognitive load at each step
- Identify error-prone interactions

### 4. Execute Usability Testing
- Design test scenarios for critical tasks
- Recruit representative participants (5 users catches 85% of issues)
- Observe and record user behavior
- Analyze task completion rates and error patterns

### 5. Deliver Recommendations
- Prioritize findings by severity and impact
- Provide specific design recommendations
- Include accessibility compliance status
- Define success metrics for improvements

## Jargon Glossary

- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Systematic usability assessment using established principles
- **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Step-by-step analysis of user task performance
- **OOBE**: Out-of-Box Experience -- user's first interaction with product
- **Anthropometric**: Human body measurements and physical capabilities
- **Affordance**: Design quality suggesting how an object should be used
- **Mental Model**: User's internal representation of how a system works

## Gotchas
- Systematic evaluation can be time-intensive and may slow development cycles
- Usability recommendations may conflict with technical or business constraints
- Over-focus on usability testing may miss broader user experience issues
- Different user populations may have conflicting needs

## Success Metrics
- Usability issues identified are successfully resolved in design iterations
- User task completion rates improve after implementing recommendations
- Accessibility compliance achieved for target standards
- User satisfaction scores increase following human factors improvements
- Error rates decrease for critical tasks
