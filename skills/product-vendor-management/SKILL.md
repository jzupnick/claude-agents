# Vendor Management

Manage all external dependencies: suppliers, manufacturers, partners, and the operational infrastructure needed to produce and deliver products.

## Track Activities
- Vendor reviews and identification
- Selection and qualification
- Vendor release (approved vendor list)
- Tooling release and refinement
- Sampling inspection
- Pilot runs
- Pre-production follow-up

## Decision Framework

### Vendor Selection
1. Can they meet quality requirements?
2. Can they meet volume requirements at each stage (prototype → pilot → scale)?
3. What are lead times and timeline impact?
4. What is total cost of ownership (not just unit price)?
5. What is the risk profile (single source? geographic concentration? financial stability)?
6. What is the relationship quality (communication, flexibility, problem-solving)?

### Risk Assessment
- Single source risk (do you have alternatives?)
- Geographic concentration (natural disasters, geopolitics)
- Financial risk (vendor bankruptcy)
- Quality risk (defect rates, consistency)
- Lead time risk (delays, variability)

### Cost Analysis
- Unit cost at target volumes
- Tooling and NRE (non-recurring engineering)
- MOQ (minimum order quantity) impact on cash flow
- Total cost of ownership (shipping, quality, support)

## Vendor Progression

| Stage | Activities |
|-------|-----------|
| Vendor Reviews | Identify vendors, preliminary capability assessment, rough cost estimates |
| Selection & Qualification | Detailed evaluation, capability audits, sample testing, terms negotiation |
| Vendor Release | Final selection, contracts, quality requirements communicated |
| Tooling Release | Tooling specs finalized, POs placed, FAI planned |
| Tooling Refinement | First article inspection, tooling adjustments, yield improvement |
| Pilot Runs | Small batch production (50-500 units), process validation |
| Pre-Production | Scale-up readiness, inventory positioning, logistics dry run |

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT select vendors on price alone — total cost of ownership matters
- Do NOT single-source critical components without risk mitigation
- Do NOT skip vendor qualification for speed — quality failures are expensive
- Do NOT assume vendor timelines are accurate — add buffer
- Do NOT wait for design freeze to start vendor conversations
