# design — Agent Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `accessibility-designer` | Design accessible interfaces with inclusive design patterns, WCAG guidelines, assistive technology support, and cognitive accessibility |
| `architect` | Translate design intent into implementable architecture. Use when moving from concept to code structure, making system-level design decisions, or bridging the gap between design thinking and engineering implementation. |
| `compounding-coder` | Generate UI/code from business requirements while building living design heuristics. Use when design implementation feels 'off' and you need systematic diagnosis, when debugging visual coherence issues, or when building without static mockups. |
| `design-critique-facilitator` | Facilitate structured design critiques with feedback frameworks, constructive analysis, and actionable improvement suggestions |
| `design-handoff-specialist` | Prepare design-to-development handoffs with specifications, component inventories, interaction annotations, and asset export |
| `design-metrics-analyst` | Measure design effectiveness with usability metrics, task completion rates, satisfaction scores, and design system adoption tracking |
| `design-researcher` | Conduct design research with user interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, and synthesis into actionable design insights |
| `design-sprint-facilitator` | Facilitate design sprints with problem framing, ideation exercises, rapid prototyping, and user testing within a week |
| `design-storyteller` | Craft design narratives that communicate vision, rationale, and user impact for stakeholder presentations and case studies |
| `design-system-architect` | Design and maintain design systems with tokens, components, documentation, versioning, and cross-platform consistency |
| `design-system-governance-expert` | Establish design system governance with contribution guidelines, review processes, deprecation policies, and adoption metrics |
| `feasibility` | Validate product design feasibility before development investment. Use when assessing technical, manufacturing, market, or economic feasibility of product concepts, when making Go/No-Go decisions on new products, or when checking design constraints early. |
| `human-factors` | Use when applying human factors and ergonomics principles, conducting usability analysis, or designing for accessibility and user safety |
| `information-architect` | Design information architectures with content organization, taxonomy, navigation systems, and findability optimization |
| `interaction-designer` | Design interaction patterns with micro-interactions, transitions, gesture systems, and responsive behavior specifications |
| `mobile-ux-designer` | Design mobile user experiences with touch interactions, navigation patterns, gesture shortcuts, and platform-appropriate conventions |
| `parallel-ux` | Coordinate parallel physical product and user experience development. Use when building products with both hardware and software components, when hardware and UX tracks need synchronization, or when managing cross-track dependencies between physical and digital design. |
| `persona-creator` | Create evidence-based user personas with demographic data, behavioral patterns, goals, pain points, and usage scenarios |
| `prototyping-expert` | Build interactive prototypes with clickable wireframes, animation sequences, and user flow simulations for validation testing |
| `review` | Translate opportunity into product architecture and specifications. Use when creating design summaries, concept development, system architecture, requirements specs, or preliminary BOMs for product development. |
| `system-prototyper` | Rapidly prototype UI components, pages, or layouts using existing design systems. Use when building landing pages, recreating app layouts, creating composite layout components, or translating business requirements into React components. |
| `usability-tester` | Plan and conduct usability tests with task scenarios, participant recruitment, observation protocols, and findings reports |
| `user-journey-mapper` | Map user journey flows with touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunity identification across service channels |
| `ux-researcher` | Conduct UX research with qualitative and quantitative methods, synthesis frameworks, and evidence-based design recommendations |
| `visual-designer` | Create visual designs with typography, color systems, iconography, illustration styles, and brand-consistent UI elements |
| `voice-ui-designer` | Design voice user interfaces with conversation flows, intent mapping, error recovery, and multi-modal interaction patterns |
| `wireframe-designer` | Create wireframes with layout structure, content hierarchy, component placement, and responsive breakpoint planning |
