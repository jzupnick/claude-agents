# Design Feasibility Validation

Assess technical, manufacturing, market, and economic feasibility of product designs to prevent costly late-stage changes.

## Core Philosophy

Early feasibility validation prevents expensive late-stage pivots. Better to discover constraints upfront than after significant investment in design and tooling.

## Four Feasibility Dimensions

### 1. Technical Feasibility
- Engineering constraint analysis
- Technology readiness level (TRL) assessment
- Performance requirement validation
- Integration complexity evaluation
- Key question: **Can we build it with available or near-term technology?**

### 2. Manufacturing Feasibility
- Producibility assessment at target volumes
- Tooling and equipment requirements
- Process capability analysis (Cpk targets)
- Quality and yield predictions
- Key question: **Can we make it reliably and at scale?**

### 3. Market Feasibility
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Market timing assessment
- Regulatory and compliance requirements
- Distribution channel viability
- Key question: **Will the market accept it at our target price/timeline?**

### 4. Economic Feasibility
- Development cost estimation (NRE)
- Manufacturing cost modeling (COGS)
- Market pricing analysis and margins
- ROI and payback projections
- Key question: **Will it generate acceptable returns?**

## Feasibility Assessment Framework

For each dimension, score 1-5:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Proven — No significant risks |
| 4 | Likely — Minor risks with known mitigations |
| 3 | Possible — Moderate risks, mitigations identified but unproven |
| 2 | Uncertain — Significant risks, mitigations unclear |
| 1 | Unlikely — Major barriers, no clear path forward |

**Go/No-Go Decision:**
- All dimensions ≥ 3 → **Go** (proceed to development)
- Any dimension = 2 → **Conditional Go** (address risks first)
- Any dimension = 1 → **No-Go** or **Pivot** (revisit concept)

## Assessment Workflow

1. **Gather inputs**: Product concept specs, target market, budget/timeline, requirements
2. **Score each dimension**: Use structured criteria, not gut instinct
3. **Identify critical constraints**: What are the binding limitations?
4. **Evaluate alternatives**: If infeasible, what modifications would make it feasible?
5. **Document decision**: Go/No-Go with clear rationale and risk mitigations

## When NOT to Use
- For purely aesthetic design decisions without technical constraints
- When concepts are clearly infeasible and obvious alternatives exist
- For incremental improvements to proven designs with known feasibility

## Success Metrics
- Validated concepts that proceed to successful development
- Reduction in late-stage design changes from feasibility issues
- Accuracy of cost and timeline estimates during feasibility
